# Conclusion
Our exploration on 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census dataset reveals several intriguing patterns of Eastern Gray squirrels in their distribution, behavior, and interaction with humans. Spatially, while squirrels are found throughout the park, they have clusters in specific areas, like the north of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, the middle of the park, and the southwest corner. 

Time-wise, we found a consistent activity patterns across morning and late afternoon shifts, with notable peaks in sighting frequency around October 7th and 13th. This patterns may be influenced by data collection methods as weekend dates showing increased sightings due to higher volunteer availability. Some dates have higher frequency in one shift than other, which may due to weather as rainy weather affecting both squirrel visibility and their activities.

Behaviorally, foraging is the dominant activity. It comprises approximately 60% of adult squirrel sightings and 50% of juvenile sightings. Juvenile squirrels were more energetic, engaging more frequently in running, climbing, and chasing behaviors compared to adults. Location seems to influence behavior patterns, with ground-level squirrels showing more running and foraging activities, while squirrels on trees exhibit more climbing and chasing behaviors.

Regarding interaction with humans when being sighted, squirrels generally showed avoidance behavior or indifference to human presence. However, those in the southern part of the park were more likely to approach humans while foraging or eating. This suggests possible habituation to human presence in high-traffic areas. We also found that when squirrels approaching huamans, they consistently make Kuks sounds regardless of their locations. Meanwhile, Moans were specifically associated with above-ground escape behaviors.

We also studied interesting fur color patterns, with gray being the predominant fur color (over 2,000 sightings), followed by cinnamon (under 500 sightings), and black (fewer than 250 sightings). While these color morphs showed distinct spatial distribution patterns, with black squirrels concentrated near the Reservoir and southeast park areas, and cinnamon squirrels more common in the south, their behavioral patterns remained consistent across all color variations.

**Limitations**\
This dataset represents individual sighting moments without mechanisms for tracking unique squirrels over time. While there is an estimated of 2,373 Eastern Gray squirrels in Central Park, the dataset includes over 3,000 sightings. This discrepancy suggests that some squirrels were likely recorded multiple times. Such repeated sightings can occur when the same squirrel is observed at different times, in different locations, or even during the same observation session. Thus it may not accurately reflect the distribution of the squirrels, especially coming to distribution of squirrels with different fur colors.

Additionally, the data collection was conducted manually by volunteers, which introduces potential biases. While the volunteers objectively recorded behaviors, subjective differences among data collectors might influence observations, particularly in interpreting interactions with humans. For example, behaviors such as approaching or fleeing from humans might vary depending on the volunteersâ€™ behavior during the observations. These inconsistencies could affect the reliability of the interaction data. Also, weekend observations may be over-represented due to higher volunteer availability. 

Lastly, Squirrel behaviors are likely influenced by seasonal changes, weather conditions, and food availability. But the data was only collected within 20 consecutive days. It would be more comprehensive to collect data throughout the years or even across different years. However, since this is a volunteering project, the resources are very limited.
