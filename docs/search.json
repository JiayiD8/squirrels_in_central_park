    "text": "1 Introduction\nWe choose to explore this dataset becuase we are interested in squirrels activities in NYC central parks. Central part plays a main role in New Yorkers life and tourist’s experience as it provide unique chance for people to interact with wildlife in the middle of the urban life. Understanding the activity patterns of squirrels can help us learn how to coexist with them and appreciate their role in the park’s ecosystem.\nThe dataset provides detailed information about the squirrels in central part, including their physical attributes such as fur color and age, sighting distribution across the park, and behaviors such as climbing, foraging, and making sounds. It also captures interactions between squirrels and humans, such as approaches, indifference, or avoidance, giving a sense that how these animals react to the appearence of human in their living environment.\nBy analyzing this data, we are explring questions about the squirrels’ location patterns, activity preferences, and social behaviors, while also discovering ecological trends within the park.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census dataset is a squirrel sighting data collected by 23 volunteer Squirrel Sighters in October of 2018. Throughout two weeks of time, they will walk around the Central Park and document each sighting of squirrels. From their website The Squirrel Census, they don’t have a specific data collecting and updating cycle, as they collected data in 2012, 2016, 2018 and 2020. This may due to the fact that this is more like a volunteering project. We are not using the latest data because it only includes 434 sightings but were collected from 24 different parks, making the data too sparse to analyze. Therefore, we choose the 2018 dataset that focused on the squirrels in Central Park. The dataset is in tabular format with 3023 rows and 31 columns. Each row is an instance of sighting squirrels. The columns capture different aspect of the sighting, including location, time, number of squirrels, what were squirrels doing, etc. The data were well-collected and well-documented, so there is no issue interpreting them. One issue was some data are in the type of Checkbox, but if downloading the dataset as a csv file, which is an available option, Checkbox type will be automaticly convert into True and False values. Additionally, there are some extra information columns that contains field notes, which we need to consider how to deal with.\nSource of data: Squirrel Census Dateset, The Squirrel Census official website",

The fifth one also have around 35% missing data. However, these does not cause any major issue because these five columns hold the text data that serves as field notes. They record additional information about squirrel colors, how they interact with people, what they are doing and the specific location they were found like “under a tree”. These won’t affect our main exploratory analysis as we won’t be using them. But we will use them as notes when creating a interactive map to demonstrate the spacial distribution of squirrels within Central Park.\nFor the rest of the missing value, we may choose to either remove the rows directly, as they only take a small portion of the data, or assign a special value to them.\nNow we will take a closer look at the distribution of the columns with top five number of missing values.\nA more detailed visualization of the top five missing value with the library naniar\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(naniar)\ngg_miss_upset(squirrel_data) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe upset plot help show how missing value in the top five variable(with most NAs in the percentage plot) overlapping with each others. The horizontal bars at the bottom left is a brief view of the count for the top five missing value. The connected dots in the bottom providing information about which columns contribute to the overlapped missing count showed in the vertical bar above. For example, there are 1224 rows have missing values in all four variables (except highlight fur color). This indicates that more than 1/3 of all the cases, those columns that records additional notes other than previous Yes/No checks are all empty. As we doing further analysis, we can consider encoding those columns into Y/N factors variables based on having additional info or not.",

They are widespread and seen almost everywhere on the map. Cinnamon-colored squirrels are less common and appear more scattered on the lower side of the park. Black squirrels are the rarest, with only a few sightings concentrated in specific areas. Such data might because of the ways of data collection that there might only be several black squirrels and the data are clustered because different people sighted it around it’s drey at different time.\n\n\n3.1.3 How do sighted behaviors differ among black, cinnamon, and gray morphs of Eastern Gray squirrels in Central Park?\nAs the number of squirrels with different colors are largely imbalanced, we plot the stacked proportion bar plot to explore if sighted behaviors differ among black, cinnamon, and gray squirrels.\n\n\nCode\n# assuming squirrel_data has columns like Primary.Fur.Color, Running, Chasing, Climbing, Eating, Foraging \nproportion_data &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(Running, Chasing, Climbing, Eating, Foraging), \n    names_to = \"Behavior\",\n    values_to = \"Observed\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(Observed == \"true\") |&gt;\n  # Count number of squirrels per Behavior & Primary.Fur.Color\n  group_by(Primary.Fur.Color, Behavior) |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nlibrary(paletteer)\n\nggplot(proportion_data, aes(x = Primary.Fur.Color, y = Count, fill = Behavior)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"fill\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proportion of Behaviors by Primary Fur Color\",\n    x = \"Primary Fur Color\",\n    y = \"Proportion of Squirrels\",\n    fill = \"Behavior\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_paletteer_d(\"ggthemes::Miller_Stone\", direction = -1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows that in Central Park appears uniform across fur colors, with foraging and running being the most frequent activities while squirrels are sighted.",

    "text": "3.2 What are the overall Eastern Gray squirrels’ spatiotemporal distributions and activity patterns in Central Park?\nSince, we see no behavioral difference between across squirrels with different fur colors, we then explore the overall distribution of entire squirrel species.\n\n3.2.1 What is the spatial concentration of Eastern Gray squirrel sightings within Central Park?\n\n\nCode\n# Extract coordinates from the point data\nsquirrel_coords &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    coords = str_extract(Lat.Long, \"\\\\(.*\\\\)\"),\n    coords = str_remove_all(coords, \"[\\\\(\\\\)]\"),\n    longitude = as.numeric(word(coords, 1)),\n    latitude = as.numeric(word(coords, 2))\n  )\n\nggplot(squirrel_coords, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) +\n  geom_hex(bins = 40) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(palette = \"Blues\", direction = 1) +\n    scale_x_continuous(\n    labels = function(x) paste0(abs(x), \"°W\"),  \n    breaks = seq(-74, -73.95, by = 0.01)        \n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = function(y) paste0(y, \"°N\"),      \n    breaks = seq(40.76, 40.8, by = 0.005)       \n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Squirrel Location Density\",\n    subtitle = \"Hexagon binning visualization\",\n    x = \"Longitude\",\n    y = \"Latitude\",\n    fill = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  coord_fixed()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this plot, we can see that squirrels are spread throughout the central park, but they tend to cluster more heavily in certain areas. The darker-colored hexagons show spots where more sightings of squirrels are located, suggesting these places might be particularly attractive to them—maybe because of food sources, water, shelter, or other favorable conditions. To be specific, northern side of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, right next to the lake, and the lower right corner, are some of the “hotspot” for squirrels.\n\n\n3.2.2 How does the frequency of Eastern Gray squirrel sightings vary across different times of day, different dates, and weather conditions in Central Park?\n\n\nCode\n# convert the Date column to proper date format\nsquirrel_data_ridgeline &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Date = as.Date(Date, format = \"%m%d%Y\"),\n    # make shift a factor with PM first so AM appears on top\n    Shift = factor(Shift, levels = c(\"Late Afternoon\", \"Morning\"))\n  )\n\n# ridgeline plot\nggplot(squirrel_data_ridgeline, aes(x = Date, y = Shift, fill = Shift)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    alpha = 0.6,\n    scale = 0.9,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"Morning\" = \"#FDB462\", \"Late Afternoon\" = \"#80B1D3\")\n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    # Show every date on x-axis\n    date_breaks = \"1 day\",\n    date_labels = \"%b %d\",\n    expand = c(0.01, 0) \n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Squirrel Sightings\",\n    subtitle = \"By Time of Day\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Shift\"\n  ) +\n  theme_ridges() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the distribution of squirrel sightings across days in October, divided into morning (AM) and afternoon (PM) shifts. The overall sighting density are similar for morning and afternoon across October, except several days like Oct 07, 10, 13, and 14. This could becuause different weather condition across the day. For example, on Oct 07 and 08, it was rainy in the late afternoon, so we sighted more squirrels in the morning. In contrast, more sightings happened in the afternoon on 13nd and 14th since it rains in the morning.\n\n\n3.2.3 How are Eastern Gray squirrel’s activity patterns affected by age and environmental features?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(scales)\nbehavior &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n  select(Age, Running, Chasing, Climbing, Eating, Foraging, Shift) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(Running, Chasing, Climbing, Eating, Foraging),\n    names_to = \"Behavior\",\n    values_to = \"Observed\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(Observed == \"true\") |&gt;\n  # summarize counts per Age, Behavior, and Shift\n  group_by(Age, Behavior, Shift) |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  # now group by Age and Shift to get the total count for that subset\n  group_by(Age, Shift) |&gt;\n  mutate(Proportion = Count / sum(Count)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(behavior, aes(x = reorder(Behavior, -Proportion), y = Proportion, fill = Age)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Comparison of Behaviors by Age and Shift (Proportion)\",\n    x = \"Behavior\",\n    y = \"Proportion of Squirrels\",\n    fill = \"Age Group\"\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~Shift) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent()) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"Adult\" = \"#502419\", \"Juvenile\" = \"#7ea172\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most interesting observation is that foraging dominates squirrels’ sighted behaviors for both Adult and Juvenile squirrels across the day. The activities related to foods, foraging and eating, take nearly 60% of Adult squirrels’ sighted activities and around 50% of Juvenile squirrels’ sighted activities. There is even an increase in proportion of foraging and eating sighted in\n\n\nCode\n# foraging_alluvial_data &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n#   filter(Foraging == \"true\") |&gt;\n#   drop_na(Location, Shift) |&gt;\n#   group_by(Shift, Location) |&gt;\n#   summarize(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n#   mutate(\n#     Shift = factor(Shift),\n#     Location = factor(Location)\n#   )\n# \n# ggplot(foraging_alluvial_data,\n#        aes(axis1 = Shift, axis2 = Location, y = Count, fill = Location)) +\n#   geom_alluvium(color = \"black\") +\n#   geom_stratum() +\n#   geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), size = 2) +\n#   scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0.1, 0.1)) +\n#   labs(\n#     title = \"Foraging Patterns Across Shift and Location\",\n#     x = \"\", \n#     y = \"Count\"\n#   ) +\n#   theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbehavior_location &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n  select(Running, Chasing, Climbing, Eating, Foraging, Location) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(Running, Chasing, Climbing, Eating, Foraging),\n    names_to = \"Behavior\",\n    values_to = \"Observed\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(Observed == \"true\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Behavior, Location) |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")  \n\nmosaic_table &lt;- xtabs(Count ~ Location + Behavior, data = behavior_location)\n\ncolors &lt;- paletteer_d(\"ggthemes::Miller_Stone\")\nhighlighting_colors &lt;- tail(colors, 5)\n\n# Apply the colors to the mosaic plot\nvcd::mosaic(\n  ~ Behavior + Location,\n  data = mosaic_table,\n  direction = c(\"h\", \"v\"),\n  highlighting = \"Behavior\",\n  highlighting_fill = highlighting_colors, # Using the last five colors\n  shade = TRUE,\n  legend = FALSE,\n  main = \"Mosaic of Behaviors by Location\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we mainly interested in how squirrels’ behaviors varied, we would like to explore various other variables. About three third of the data are made on the ground level as people’s vision are limited to catch squirrels in the tree. Clearly, ground plane squirrels show more running and foraging behaviors, while above ground squirrels exhibit more climbing and chasing activities. The pattern is reasonable that the high frequency of ground foraging aligns with squirrels’ feeding patterns - they mainly eat nuts and pine cones which typically fall to the ground when mature. Eating behavior seems to be equally frequent to be sighted for both setting.\n\n\n3.2.4 How do Eastern Gray squirrels interact with humans when being sighted?\nPrevious plot results that running and climbing might be solely related to the sighted location, hence, we want to take a closer look at the squirrels’ foraging and eating behaviors and any possible correlation with their attitude when interacting with human.\n\n\nCode\nbubble_data &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n  select(X, Y, Eating, Foraging, Approaches, Runs.from) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(Eating, Foraging),\n    names_to = \"Behavior\",\n    values_to = \"Observed_Behavior\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(Approaches, Runs.from),\n    names_to = \"Interaction\",\n    values_to = \"Observed_Interaction\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(Observed_Behavior == \"true\" & Observed_Interaction == \"true\") |&gt;\n  group_by(X, Y, Behavior, Interaction) |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"X\", \"Y\"), crs = 4326)\n\n# Plotting using geom_sf\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = bubble_data, aes(color = Interaction), size = 3, shape = 1, alpha = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~Behavior) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Human Interactions by Behavior and Location\",\n    size = \"Interaction Count\",\n    color = \"Human Interation\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, there are more squirrels running from humans rather than approaching them. For both foraging and eating squirrels, more of them are likely to approach humans in the southern part of the park. This pattern might be due to higher foot traffic and more frequent feeding by visitors in the southern areas, potentially making squirrels there more habituated to human presence.\nThen we exploring how do these two variables, location and human interaction attitude, related to the sound squirrels made.\n\n\nCode\nsound_interaction &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n  select(Kuks, Quaas, Moans, Location, Approaches, Indifferent, Runs.from) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(Approaches, Indifferent, Runs.from),\n    names_to = \"Interaction\",\n    values_to = \"Observed_Interaction\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(Kuks, Quaas, Moans),\n    names_to = \"Sound\",\n    values_to = \"Sound_Value\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(Sound_Value == \"true\", Observed_Interaction == \"true\") |&gt;\n  drop_na(Interaction, Sound, Location) |&gt;\n  group_by(Location, Interaction, Sound) |&gt;\n  summarize(Freq = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nggplot(sound_interaction,\n       aes(axis1 = Location, axis2 = Sound, axis3 = Interaction, y = Freq, fill = Sound)) +\n  geom_alluvium(color = \"grey\") +\n  geom_stratum() +\n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum))) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Transition of Human Interactions Across location and sound\",\n    x = \"Categories\",\n    y = \"Count of Observed Behaviors\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set3\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKuks are more common since squirrels make such chirpy vocal communication used for a variety of reasons. are above ground and tend to lead to indifferent reactions. Moans only occurs when squirrels see a air predator like hawk but there are few air predictors in the city so moans is the least frequent sound only for squirrels above ground and results in imediate rans away. Quaas occurs with a presence of a ground predator, like a dog or human, so squirrels tend to run away or act indifferent from human’s presence.\n\n\nCode\n# coord_sf &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n#   st_as_sf(coords = c('X', 'Y'), crs = 4326) |&gt;\n#   pivot_longer(\n#     cols = c(Running, Chasing, Climbing, Eating, Foraging), \n#     names_to = \"Behavior\",\n#     values_to = \"Observed\"\n#   ) |&gt;\n#   filter(Observed == \"true\") \n#   # No group_by needed if not summarizing\n# \n# ggplot() + \n#   geom_sf(data = coord_sf, aes(color = Primary.Fur.Color), \n#           size = 1.5, shape = 1, alpha = 0.7) + \n#   scale_color_manual(values = c('black', '#D2691E', 'grey')) + \n#   facet_wrap(~ Behavior) +\n#   theme_minimal() +\n#   labs(title = 'Squirrel Sighting Locations by Color')\n# \n# behavior_data &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n#   select(Age, Shift, Running, Chasing, Climbing, Eating, Foraging) |&gt;\n#   pivot_longer(\n#     cols = c(Running, Chasing, Climbing, Eating, Foraging),\n#     names_to = \"Behavior\",\n#     values_to = \"Observed\"\n#   ) |&gt;\n#   filter(Observed == \"true\") |&gt;\n#   group_by(Shift, Age, Behavior) |&gt;\n#   summarize(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")",

    "text": "4.2 Did you spot any interesting patterns?\nStandard gray squirrels were sighted across the Central Park, as this is the most common fur color. But there are still several significant clustering of sightings located at south west corner of the park, middle of the park and north of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir. Cinnamon squirrels sightings were clustered at the south west corner of the park as well, while spreading sporadically across north of the park. Black squirrels were encountered the fewest, mostly at the north of the park.\nInterestingly, both gray and cinnamon squirrels were sighted a lot at the south west corner of the park, near the Columbus Circle. The popularity of this entrance may lead people to feed the squirrels more frequently or leave more food debris behind. Thus more squirrels are attracted to here.\nThe distribution of cinnamon and black squirrels sightings locations have only a few overlapping areas. This is an intriguing pattern we noticed but we also don’t have a proper explanation.",
