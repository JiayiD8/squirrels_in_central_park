    "text": "1 Introduction\nWe choose to explore this dataset becuase we are interested in squirrels activities in NYC central parks. Central part plays a main role in New Yorkers life and tourist’s experience as it provide unique chance for people to interact with wildlife in the middle of the urban life. Understanding the activity patterns of squirrels can help us learn how to coexist with them and appreciate their role in the park’s ecosystem.\nThe dataset provides detailed information about the squirrels in central part, including their physical attributes such as fur color and age, sighting distribution across the park, and behaviors such as climbing, foraging, and making sounds. It also captures interactions between squirrels and humans, such as approaches, indifference, or avoidance, giving a sense that how these animals react to the appearence of human in their living environment.\nBy analyzing this data, we are explring questions about the squirrels’ location patterns, activity preferences, and social behaviors, while also discovering ecological trends within the park.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census dataset is a squirrel sighting data collected by 23 volunteer Squirrel Sighters in October of 2018. Throughout two weeks of time, they will walk around the Central Park and document each sighting of squirrels. From their website The Squirrel Census, they don’t have a specific data collecting and updating cycle, as they collected data in 2012, 2016, 2018 and 2020. This may due to the fact that this is more like a volunteering project. We are not using the latest data because it only includes 434 sightings but were collected from 24 different parks, making the data too sparse to analyze. Therefore, we choose the 2018 dataset that focused on the squirrels in Central Park. The dataset is in tabular format with 3023 rows and 31 columns. Each row is an instance of sighting squirrels. The columns capture different aspect of the sighting, including location, time, number of squirrels, what were squirrels doing, etc. The data were well-collected and well-documented, so there is no issue interpreting them. One issue was some data are in the type of Checkbox, but if downloading the dataset as a csv file, which is an available option, Checkbox type will be automaticly convert into True and False values. Additionally, there are some extra information columns that contains field notes, which we need to consider how to deal with.\nSource of data: Squirrel Census Dateset, The Squirrel Census official website",

The fifth one also have around 35% missing data. However, these does not cause any major issue because these five columns hold the text data that serves as field notes. They record additional information about squirrel colors, how they interact with people, what they are doing and the specific location they were found like “under a tree”. These won’t affect our main exploratory analysis as we won’t be using them. But we will use them as notes when creating a interactive map to demonstrate the spacial distribution of squirrels within Central Park.\nFor the rest of the missing value, we may choose to either remove the rows directly, as they only take a small portion of the data, or assign a special value to them.\nNow we will take a closer look at the distribution of the columns with top five number of missing values.\nA more detailed visualization of the top five missing value with the library naniar\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(naniar)\ngg_miss_upset(squirrel_data) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe upset plot help show how missing value in the top five variable(with most NAs in the percentage plot) overlapping with each others. The horizontal bars at the bottom left is a brief view of the count for the top five missing value. The connected dots in the bottom providing information about which columns contribute to the overlapped missing count showed in the vertical bar above. For example, there are 1224 rows have missing values in all four variables (except highlight fur color). This indicates that more than 1/3 of all the cases, those columns that records additional notes other than previous Yes/No checks are all empty. As we doing further analysis, we can consider encoding those columns into Y/N factors variables based on having additional info or not.",

The darker-colored hexagons show spots where more sightings of squirrels are located, suggesting these places might be particularly attractive to them—maybe because of food sources, water, shelter, or other favorable conditions. To be specific, northern side of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, middle of the park, and the south-west corner are some of the “hotspot” for squirrels.\n\n\n3.1.2 How does the frequency of Eastern Gray squirrel sightings vary across different times of day and different dates in Central Park?\n\n\nCode\n# convert the Date column to proper date format\nsquirrel_data_ridgeline &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Date = as.Date(Date, format = \"%m%d%Y\"),\n    # make shift a factor so Morning appears on top\n    Shift = factor(Shift, levels = c(\"Late Afternoon\", \"Morning\"))\n  )\n\n# ridgeline plot\nggplot(squirrel_data_ridgeline, aes(x = Date, y = Shift, fill = Shift)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    alpha = 0.6,\n    scale = 0.9,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"Morning\" = \"#FDB462\", \"Late Afternoon\" = \"#80B1D3\")\n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    # Show every date on x-axis\n    date_breaks = \"1 day\",\n    date_labels = \"%b %d\",\n    expand = c(0.01, 0) \n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Squirrel Sightings\",\n    subtitle = \"By Time of Day\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Shift\"\n  ) +\n  theme_ridges(14) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(hjust = 0.5, vjust = -1),  \n    axis.title.y = element_text(hjust = 0.5, vjust = 2)    \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ridgeline plot shows the distribution of squirrel sightings across days in October when the sighting data were collected by volunteers, divided into morning (AM) and late afternoon (PM) shifts. The overall sighting density are similar for morning and afternoon across October, as there are three peaks around Oct 07, Oct13 and Oct 18. Meanwhile, there are still subtle differences within a day between shifts like a higher peak for Morning Oct 07 and higher peak for late Afternoon Oct 13.\nThere could be several explanations for the patterns observed. Weather is one of them. Different weather conditions across the day could affect if we could encounter squirrels. After we search for historical weather data, on Oct 07 and 08, it was rainy in the late afternoon, so we sighted more squirrels in the morning. In contrast, more sightings happened in the afternoon on 13nd and 14th since it rains in the morning. Data collecting procedure could be another influencing factor. Since this is a volunteering project. People are more available during the weekend, which were dates such as Oct 6-7 and Oct 13-14. Thus the frequency peak at those dates as more vonlunteers were collecting the sighting data.\n\n\n3.1.3 How are Eastern Gray squirrel’s activity patterns affected by age and environmental features?\n\n\nCode\n# Pivot the columns for plotting\nbehavior &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n  select(Age, Running, Chasing, Climbing, Eating, Foraging, Shift) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(Running, Chasing, Climbing, Eating, Foraging),\n    names_to = \"Behavior\",\n    values_to = \"Observed\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(Observed == \"true\") |&gt;\n  # summarize counts per Age, Behavior, and Shift\n  group_by(Age, Behavior, Shift) |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  # now group by Age and Shift to get the total count for that subset\n  group_by(Age, Shift) |&gt;\n  mutate(Proportion = Count / sum(Count)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(behavior, aes(x = reorder(Behavior, -Proportion), y = Proportion, fill = Age)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(\n    title = expression(bold(\"Comparison of Behaviors by Age and Shift (Proportion)\")),\n    x = \"Behavior\",\n    y = \"Proportion of Squirrels\",\n    fill = \"Age Group\"\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~Shift) +\n  theme_minimal(14) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5) \n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent()) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"Adult\" = \"#502419\", \"Juvenile\" = \"#7ea172\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most interesting observation is that foraging dominates squirrels’ sighted behaviors for both adult and juvenile squirrels across the day. The activities related to foods, foraging and eating, take nearly 60% of adult squirrels’ sighted activities and around 50% of juvenile squirrels’ sighted activities. There is even an increase in proportion of foraging and eating sighted duting late afternoon for adult squirrels. This makes sense as these activities relate to survival.\nJuvenile squirrels were definitely way more energetic, as they spend more time running, climbing and chasing than adult squirrels during both time of the day.\n\n\nCode\nbehavior_location &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n  select(Running, Chasing, Climbing, Eating, Foraging, Location) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(Running, Chasing, Climbing, Eating, Foraging),\n    names_to = \"Behavior\",\n    values_to = \"Observed\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(Observed == \"true\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Behavior, Location) |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")  \n\nmosaic_table &lt;- xtabs(Count ~ Location + Behavior, data = behavior_location)\n\ncolors &lt;- paletteer_d(\"ggthemes::Miller_Stone\")\nhighlighting_colors &lt;- tail(colors, 5)\n\n# Apply the colors to the mosaic plot\nvcd::mosaic(\n  ~ Behavior + Location,\n  data = mosaic_table,\n  direction = c(\"h\", \"v\"),\n  highlighting = \"Behavior\",\n  highlighting_fill = highlighting_colors, # Using the last five colors\n  shade = TRUE,\n  legend = FALSE,\n  main = \"Mosaic Plot of Behaviors by Location\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we explored how squirrels’ activity patterns vary when sighted on the ground and above the ground. About three third of the data are made on the ground level as people’s vision are limited to catch squirrels in the tree. Clearly, ground plane squirrels show more running and foraging behaviors, while above ground squirrels exhibit more climbing and chasing activities. The pattern is intuitive as the high frequency of ground foraging aligns with squirrels’ feeding patterns - they mainly eat nuts and pine cones which typically fall to the ground when mature, and the high frequency of climbing when squirrels are sighted above the ground on the trees is pretty natural. Eating seems to be equally frequent to be sighted for both environments.\n\n\n3.1.4 How do Eastern Gray squirrels interact with humans when being sighted?\nAfter analyzing the spatial distribution and environmental influences on Eastern Gray squirrels in Central Park, it’s essential to examine their behavioral patterns when being encountered. We explore not only how squirrels interact with humans when sighted, but also the vocalizations they produce during these interactions.\n\n\nCode\n# Data for the plot\nbubble_data &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n  select(X, Y, Eating, Foraging, Approaches, Runs.from) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(Eating, Foraging),\n    names_to = \"Behavior\",\n    values_to = \"Observed_Behavior\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(Approaches, Runs.from),\n    names_to = \"Interaction\",\n    values_to = \"Observed_Interaction\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(Observed_Behavior == \"true\" & Observed_Interaction == \"true\") |&gt;\n  group_by(X, Y, Behavior, Interaction) |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"X\", \"Y\"), crs = 4326)\n\n# Plotting accurate spatial distribution using geom_sf\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = bubble_data, aes(color = Interaction), size = 3, shape = 1, alpha = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~Behavior) +\n  labs(\n    title = expression(bold(\"Distribution of Reaction to Human Presence\\nby Behavior and Location\")),\n    size = \"Interaction Count\",\n    color = \"Reaction to Human Presence\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(22) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set1\",\n                     labels = c(\"Approaches\" = \"Approaches\", \n                                \"Runs.from\" = \"Runs From\")) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 12), \n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), \n        panel.spacing = unit(5, \"lines\"),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        plot.margin = margin(t = 28)\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, there are more squirrels running from humans rather than approaching them, as this is a natural reaction by wild life. For squirrels that are either foraging or eating, more of them are more likely to approach humans in the southern part of the park. This pattern might be due to higher foot traffic and more frequent feeding by visitors in the southern areas, potentially making squirrels there more habituated to human presence.\n\n\nCode\nsound_interaction &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n  mutate(across(everything(), ~replace_na(., \"Unknown\"))) |&gt;\n  select(Kuks, Quaas, Moans, Location, Approaches, Indifferent, Runs.from) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(Approaches, Indifferent, Runs.from),\n    names_to = \"Interaction\",\n    values_to = \"Observed_Interaction\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(Kuks, Quaas, Moans),\n    names_to = \"Sound\",\n    values_to = \"Sound_Value\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(Sound_Value == \"true\", Observed_Interaction == \"true\") |&gt;\n  drop_na(Interaction, Sound, Location) |&gt;\n  group_by(Location, Interaction, Sound) |&gt;\n  summarize(Freq = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(Sound)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Interaction = str_replace(Interaction, \"Runs.from\", \"Runs from\"))\n\nggplot(sound_interaction,\n       aes(axis1 = Interaction, axis2 = Sound, axis3 = Location, y = Freq, fill = Interaction)) +\n  geom_alluvium(color = \"grey\") +\n  geom_stratum() +\n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", \n            aes(label = after_stat(stratum)),\n            size = 3.2) +\n  labs(\n    title = expression(bold(\"Distribution of Squirrel Responses to Human Presence\\nby Vocalizations and Locations\")),\n    y = \"Count of Observed Behaviors\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(16) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.margin = margin(t = 22)) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set3\", na.translate = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_discrete(\n    limits = c(\"Interaction\", \"Sound\", \"Location\"),\n    labels = c(\"Reaction\", \"Vocalization\", \"Location\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst we want to explain the difference between three vocalizations. Kuks is a chirpy vocal communication used for a variety of reasons. Moans is a high-pitched vocal communication which can indicate the presence of an air predator such as a hawk. Quaas is an elongated vocal communication which can indicate the presence of a ground predator such as a dog.\nFor all sightings where squirrels approaches human, they make Kuks sound regardless of their locations, indicating they do not see humans as a potential threat. Moans only occurs when squirrels run away from human and were sighted about the ground. However this sound indicate the presence of air predators. Therefore, they could be running away for a different reason. Overall squirrels seem to make Kuks and Quaas in a similar frequency in different location and with different reactions.",

We wonder if there is any interesting difference if we look at squirrels with different colors separately. We will explore that in this section.\n\n3.2.1 What is the total number of sightings of black, cinnamon, and gray morphs of Eastern Gray squirrels within Central Park?\n\n\nCode\nggplot(squirrel_data, aes(x = fct_infreq(Primary.Fur.Color), fill = Primary.Fur.Color)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(\n    title = expression(bold(\"Counts by Primary Fur Color\")),\n    x = \"Primary Fur Color\",\n    y = \"Count of Squirrels\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(14) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c('black', '#D2691E', 'grey'), guide = FALSE) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar plot shows that Eastern Gray squirrels with gray fur are the most commonly sighted in Central Park, with over 2,000 encounters. Cinnamon-colored squirrels are less common, with less than 500 sightings, while black-colored squirrels are the rarest, with fewer than 250 sightings.\n\n\n3.2.2 What is the spatial distribution of black, cinnamon, and gray morphs of Eastern Gray squirrels across Central Park?\n\n\nCode\n# Change the locations data into simple feature format so it can be passed into by geom_sf\ncoord_sf_obj &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n  st_as_sf(coords = c('X', 'Y'), crs = 4326) # crs=4326 refers to the \"Coordinate Reference System\" with EPSG code 4326. This ensures the coordinates are plot correctly.\n\nggplot() + \n    geom_sf(data = coord_sf_obj, aes(color = squirrel_data$Primary.Fur.Color), \n            size = 1.5, shape = 1, alpha = .7) + \n    scale_colour_manual(values = c('black', '#D2691E', 'grey')) + \n    theme_minimal(14)  +\n    labs(title = expression(bold('Squirrel Sighting Locations by Color')), \n         color = 'Primary Fur Color') +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n      axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map shows that gray fur color is the dominating fur color in the central park. They spread across the central park area and are almost everywhere. Cinnamon-colored squirrels are less common and sighted mostly around the south side of the park with several scattered on the north side. Black squirrels are the rarest, with only a few sightings concentrated in specific areas such as north of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir and south-east side of the park.\n\n\n3.2.3 How do sighted behaviors differ among black, cinnamon, and gray morphs of Eastern Gray squirrels in Central Park?\nAs the number of squirrels with different colors are largely imbalanced, we wish to explore if sighted behaviors differ among black, cinnamon, and gray squirrels.\n\n\nCode\n# Use pivot longer to reduce the column numbers for plotting\nproportion_data &lt;- squirrel_data |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(Running, Chasing, Climbing, Eating, Foraging), \n    names_to = \"Behavior\",\n    values_to = \"Observed\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(Observed == \"true\") |&gt;\n  # Count number of squirrels per Behavior & Primary.Fur.Color\n  group_by(Primary.Fur.Color, Behavior) |&gt;\n  summarize(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nggplot(proportion_data, aes(x = Primary.Fur.Color, y = Count, fill = Behavior)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"fill\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  labs(\n    title = expression(bold('Squirrel Behaviors by Primary Fur Color')),\n    x = \"Primary Fur Color\",\n    y = \"Proportion of Squirrels\",\n    fill = \"Behavior\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(14) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n  scale_fill_paletteer_d(\"ggthemes::Miller_Stone\", direction = -1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the difference seems to stay only on primary fur colors. The proportion of behaviors are very similar across squirrels with different fur colors. Foraging is the most frequent sighted activities, taking more than 25%. Climbing, eating and running are all around 20%. Chasing is the least sighted activity, only about 5%.",

    "text": "4.2 Did you spot any interesting patterns?\nStandard gray squirrels were sighted across the Central Park, as this is the most common fur color. But there are still several significant clustering of sightings located at south west corner of the park, middle of the park and north of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir. Cinnamon squirrels sightings were clustered at the south west corner of the park as well, while spreading sporadically across north of the park. Black squirrels were encountered the fewest, mostly at the north of the park.\nInterestingly, both gray and cinnamon squirrels were sighted a lot at the south west corner of the park, near the Columbus Circle. The popularity of this entrance may lead people to feed the squirrels more frequently or leave more food debris behind. Thus more squirrels are attracted to here.\nThe distribution of cinnamon and black squirrels sightings locations have only a few overlapping areas. This is an intriguing pattern we noticed but we also don’t have a proper explanation.",

    "text": "Our exploration on 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census dataset reveals several intriguing patterns of Eastern Gray squirrels in their distribution, behavior, and interaction with humans. Spatially, while squirrels are found throughout the park, they have clusters in specific areas, like the north of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, the middle of the park, and the southwest corner.\nTime-wise, we found a consistent activity patterns across morning and late afternoon shifts, with notable peaks in sighting frequency around October 7th and 13th. This patterns may be influenced by data collection methods as weekend dates showing increased sightings due to higher volunteer availability. Some dates have higher frequency in one shift than other, which may due to weather as rainy weather affecting both squirrel visibility and their activities.\nBehaviorally, foraging is the dominant activity. It comprises approximately 60% of adult squirrel sightings and 50% of juvenile sightings. Juvenile squirrels were more energetic, engaging more frequently in running, climbing, and chasing behaviors compared to adults. Location seems to influence behavior patterns, with ground-level squirrels showing more running and foraging activities, while squirrels on trees exhibit more climbing and chasing behaviors.\nRegarding interaction with humans when being sighted, squirrels generally showed avoidance behavior or indifference to human presence. However, those in the southern part of the park were more likely to approach humans while foraging or eating. This suggests possible habituation to human presence in high-traffic areas. We also found that when squirrels approaching huamans, they consistently make Kuks sounds regardless of their locations. Meanwhile, Moans were specifically associated with above-ground escape behaviors.\nWe also studied interesting fur color patterns, with gray being the predominant fur color (over 2,000 sightings), followed by cinnamon (under 500 sightings), and black (fewer than 250 sightings). While these color morphs showed distinct spatial distribution patterns, with black squirrels concentrated near the Reservoir and southeast park areas, and cinnamon squirrels more common in the south, their behavioral patterns remained consistent across all color variations.\nLimitations\nThis dataset represents individual sighting moments without mechanisms for tracking unique squirrels over time. While there is an estimated of 2,373 Eastern Gray squirrels in Central Park, the dataset includes over 3,000 sightings. This discrepancy suggests that some squirrels were likely recorded multiple times. Such repeated sightings can occur when the same squirrel is observed at different times, in different locations, or even during the same observation session. Thus it may not accurately reflect the distribution of the squirrels, especially coming to distribution of squirrels with different fur colors.\nAdditionally, the data collection was conducted manually by volunteers, which introduces potential biases. While the volunteers objectively recorded behaviors, subjective differences among data collectors might influence observations, particularly in interpreting interactions with humans. For example, behaviors such as approaching or fleeing from humans might vary depending on the volunteers’ behavior during the observations. These inconsistencies could affect the reliability of the interaction data. Also, weekend observations may be over-represented due to higher volunteer availability.\nLastly, Squirrel behaviors are likely influenced by seasonal changes, weather conditions, and food availability. But the data was only collected within 20 consecutive days. It would be more comprehensive to collect data throughout the years or even across different years. However, since this is a volunteering project, the resources are very limited.",
