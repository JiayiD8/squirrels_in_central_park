    "text": "1 Introduction\nWe choose to explore this dataset becuase we are interested in squirrels activities in NYC central parks. Central part plays a main role in New Yorkers life and tourist’s experience as it provide unique chance for people to interact with wildlife in the middle of the urban life. Understanding the activity patterns of squirrels can help us learn how to coexist with them and appreciate their role in the park’s ecosystem.\nThe dataset provides detailed information about the squirrels in central part, including their physical attributes such as fur color and age, sighting distribution across the park, and behaviors such as climbing, foraging, and making sounds. It also captures interactions between squirrels and humans, such as approaches, indifference, or avoidance, giving a sense that how these animals react to the appearence of human in their living environment.\nBy analyzing this data, we are explring questions about the squirrels’ location patterns, activity preferences, and social behaviors, while also discovering ecological trends within the park.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census dataset is a squirrel sighting data collected by 23 volunteer Squirrel Sighters in October of 2018. Throughout two weeks of time, they will walk around the Central Park and document each sighting of squirrels. From their website The Squirrel Census, they don’t have a specific data collecting and updating cycle, as they collected data in 2012, 2016, 2018 and 2020. This may due to the fact that this is more like a volunteering project. We are not using the latest data because it only includes 434 sightings but were collected from 24 different parks, making the data too sparse to analyze. Therefore, we choose the 2018 dataset that focused on the squirrels in Central Park. The dataset is in tabular format with 3023 rows and 31 columns. Each row is an instance of sighting squirrels. The columns capture different aspect of the sighting, including location, time, number of squirrels, what were squirrels doing, etc. The data were well-collected and well-documented, so there is no issue interpreting them. One issue was some data are in the type of Checkbox, but if downloading the dataset as a csv file, which is an available option, Checkbox type will be automaticly convert into True and False values. Additionally, there are some extra information columns that contains field notes, which we need to consider how to deal with.",
